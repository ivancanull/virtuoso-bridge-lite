"""Cadence Maestro XML *filters* — strip raw ``maestro.sdb`` /
``active.state`` down to high-signal subsets per a YAML keep-list.

Deliberately does **not** parse XML into Python dicts.  The library's
position: XML files (raw + filtered) are the canonical setup format;
consumers that need structured data should read the XML themselves.

Pure functions — no I/O.  Both filters take / return XML strings.
